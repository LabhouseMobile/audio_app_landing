2. **WE LIMIT HOW, AND WITH WHOM, WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.**

   2. However, in addition to the transfers that we specifically indicate in the section explaining the characteristics of the different operations (point 3), we inform you of the communications that we may make, in general, and that affect all of the above processing and its legal basis.

In these cases, the personal data you provide us with will be retained and made available to the administrative or judicial authorities.  
     
3) **In the event of a corporate transaction**: In the event of a merger, acquisition, sale of all or part of its assets, or any other type of corporate transaction involving a third party, we may share, disclose, or transfer user data to the successor entity (even during the pre-transaction phase).  
     
4) **To third parties after aggregation or anonymization**: We may disclose or use aggregated or anonymized data (i.e., data that cannot be linked to an identified or identifiable natural person) for any purpose.  
     
5) **To third parties with the user's consent or other legitimate basis**: In the event that we wish to share data with third parties outside the scope of this Privacy Policy, we will, in all cases, request your consent or inform you of the same and its legitimate basis.
