We **only use your recordings and transcript content to provide you these services and for no other purpose**. In other words, we do *not* access or use the content of your recordings and transcripts for our own machine learning training, for advertising, or for any purpose unrelated to delivering the summary back to you.

This helps us diagnose technical problems, maintain security, and improve features and usability. For example, we analyze which features are used most or how long users spend on certain functions, in order to make informed decisions on improving our app. We also measure aggregate usage and trends to inform our business strategies and marketing effectiveness. *Marketing optimization:* Your usage patterns may be used internally to plan and optimize our marketing and user education efforts (for instance, to highlight under-used features or to design tutorials), but this does **not** involve sharing your personal information with outside advertisers. Any analytics or advertising measurement we perform is done using aggregated data or with the help of third-party analytics services as described below.
- **Marketing Communications:** With your account information, we may send you informational or promotional content about new features, updates, and offers for Summary AI, consistent with your subscription. We will do so in accordance with applicable laws – for example, if required, we will only send you marketing emails with your consent, and you will have the opportunity to opt-out of such emails at any time by using the unsubscribe link or contacting us. (Transactional or service-related communications, such as important account or billing notices, are not considered marketing and will be sent as needed to fulfill our contract with you.)
- **Legal Compliance and Protection:** We may use or disclose information as necessary to comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or enforceable governmental requests. This includes using data to respond to subpoenas or court orders, to enforce our Terms of Service or other agreements, to detect or investigate fraud or security issues, and to protect the rights, property, or safety of Summary AI, our users, or the public as required by law.

# **APPENDIX**

# **Summary AI Data Privacy Framework Principles**

Effective September 1, 2024

Summary AI has created this Data Privacy Framework Principles Notice (“Notice”) to describe our standards and procedures for handling Personal Information in accordance with the Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”) Principles.

This Notice supplements our Policy. Unless specifically defined in this Notice, the terms in this Notice have the same meaning as in our Policy. In case of conflict between the Policy and this Notice, this Notice prevails. In case of conflict between this Notice and the Principles, the Principles will govern.

‍**How we obtain Personal Information**

We obtain and Process Personal Information from the European Union (“**EU**”), United Kingdom (“**UK**”) (and Gibraltar), or Switzerland in different capacities:

- As a data controller, we collect and Process EU, UK and Swiss Personal Information directly from individuals, either via our publicly available website https://www.summaryai.app/, or through our mobile applications, or in connection with our customer relationships.
- Where we provide our Services in connection with an enterprise agreement, we may obtain and process EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Information on behalf of and at the instructions of our enterprise customers. In that context, such customers are the data controllers and we encourage you to read their privacy policies.

Summary AI commits to subject to the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles (collectively, the “**DPF Principles**”), all Personal Information received from the EU, the UK (and Gibraltar), or Switzerland in reliance on the DPF Principles (which includes both types of activities).

**Data Privacy Framework Principles**

**1. Notice.** Our Policy in combination with this Notice describes our privacy practices. When providing our Services as a Data Processor, our customers determine the categories of Personal Information we Process and the purposes of the processing. Accordingly, our customers are responsible for providing notice to individuals. Please see our customers’ privacy policies for more information.

**2. Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation.** Any Personal Information we receive may be processed by Summary AI for the purposes indicated in our Policy or as otherwise notified to you. We will not process Personal Information in a way that is incompatible with these purposes unless subsequently authorized by you.

We take reasonable steps to limit the collection and usage of Personal Information to that which is relevant for the purposes for which it was collected, and to ensure that such Personal Information is reliable, accurate, complete and current. Individuals are encouraged to keep their Personal Information with Summary AI up to date and may contact Summary AI as indicated below or in the Policy to request that their Personal Information be updated or corrected.

We will adhere to the DPF Principles for as long as we retain the Personal Information collected under DPF Principles.

When providing our Services as a data processor, we process and retain Personal Information as necessary to provide our Services as permitted in our agreements, or as required or permitted under applicable law.

**3. Accountability for Onward Transfer of Personal Information. Summary AI** may transfer Personal Information as described in the Policy. When providing our Services as a data processor, we disclose Personal Information as provided in our agreement with customers.

We remain responsible for the processing of Personal Information received under the DPF Principles and subsequently transferred to a third party acting as an agent if the agent Processes such Personal Information in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

**4. Security. Summary AI** takes reasonable and appropriate precautions, taking into account the risks involved in the Processing and the nature of the Personal Information, to help protect Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

**5. Access and Choice.** If we intend to use your Personal Information for a purpose that is materially different from the purposes for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized, or if we intend to disclose it to a third party acting as a Data Controller not previously identified, we will offer you the opportunity to opt out of such uses and/or disclosures where it involves non-sensitive information or opt in where sensitive information is involved.

Where appropriate, you have the right to access to the Personal Information we maintain about you and to correct, amend or delete that information when it is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of the DPF Principles by sending a written request as indicated in “Contact Us” below. We will review your request in accordance with the DPF Principles, and may limit or deny access to Personal Information as permitted by the DPF Principles.

When providing our Services as a Data Processor, we only Process and disclose the Personal Information as specified in our agreements. Our customers control how Personal Information is disclosed to us and Processed, and how it can be modified. Accordingly, if you want to request access, or to limit use or disclosure of your Personal Information, please contact the company to whom you submitted your Personal Information and that uses our Services. If you provide us with the name of the company to whom you provided your Personal Information and who is our customer, we will refer your request to that customer and support them in responding to your request.

**6. Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.** We conduct an annual self-assessment of our practices regarding Personal Information intended to verify that the assertions we make about our practices are true and that such practices have been implemented as represented.

If you have any questions or concerns, we encourage you to first write to us as indicated below. We will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of Personal Information in accordance with the DPF Principles.

For residual complaints not fully or partially resolved by other means, you may be able to invoke binding arbitration as detailed in the DPF Principles available [here](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/How-to-Submit-a-Complaint-Relating-to-a-Participating-Organization-s-Compliance-with-the-DPF-Principles-dpf).
